### Hi there, I'm Joel 👋

🧑🏻‍💻 I'm a software engineer. 

🌱 Most recently, I built Harrier, an open-source framework for accelerating CI/CD builds in GitHub Actions workflows by automating the deployment of an alternative runner infrastructure with a dedicated cache solution into users’ AWS environment. 

Read more about [Harrier](https://harrier-gha-runner.github.io) or look at the [code base](https://github.com/harrier-gha-runner/harrier-self-hosted-runner)
